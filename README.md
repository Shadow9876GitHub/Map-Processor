>A console application that calculates province positions and their neighbours

This is a simple console application that calculates provinces' positions, and their neighbours based on an appropriate input image.
You can use the application from a console (called Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Linux). The program uses flags which can be accessed after a quick

`Map.exe --help`

Command.
The application also includes automatic flags (in default_flags.txt) which can be changed for faster input.
There are also two examples next to the program so feel free to experiment with those.

Now it has "properly" implemented multiprocessing in it.

## Dependencies:
- Opencv 4.6.0 - https://opencv.org/releases/
- C++ standard library

## More information:
- This project was made in Code Blocks

## How to run?
- If you are on Windows, please for the love of God, don't try to run this in Code Blocks; try Visual Studio or Find my Itch.io project which is already compiled and ready to run (https://shadow9876.itch.io/map-processor)
- If you are on Linux try the prebuilt libraries and if that doesn't work, well... there are a dozen of tutorials which may or may not work, good luck regardless!
